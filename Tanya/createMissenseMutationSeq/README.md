Given an input of HGVS prot code and location of missense mutation it will create new columns for HGVS code used + description of isoform, original seq, and the new mutated seq.

Only handles single point mutations, if there are two missense mutations (ex) Ser243_Hist244_PheAla it will not be able to handle it (so will have to do manually ~.05%

Use the GnomADOptimizedCreateMssenseMutationSeq if the NPs are the same for a lot (it optimizes and runs so quick) in batches by using the run_mutation_batch.sh and submit_jobs.sh. It did not have all the Uniprots, so I downloaded the Uniprot ID sequences using a script and saved it as a fasta file, so the code would first load in all the AA sequences for NP and create a Uniprot Fasta dictionary from the file (uniprots_sequences.fasta) then it would first see if the previous AA at position for the first NP matched and if not then went on to second NP, etc and if all NP didn't match or it said No NP found it would use the .fasta sequence after it checked.
